- I have a choice to pick 1 dinosaur from the 3
- That means I have 33% chance of being right
- I pciked Mike
- so now the odds are as follows

33%
[Mike]

66%
[Kyle, Albert]

- Chances of Mike having eaten Joseph are 33%
- Chances of Kyle or Albert having eaten Joseph are 66%

Now that Kyle is out of the game, and I am given a chance to switch my choice, I should, because there is 66% chance that Albert ate Joseph. It may not be correct. But statistically it's a higher probability.


#2.

- Programmer has 3 sons.
- sum of their ages is 13

- there are only so many possibilities of 3 numbers adding up to 13

11 + 1 + 1  =  13
10 + 2 + 1  =  13
9  + 3 + 1  =  13
9  + 2 + 2  =  13
8  + 4 + 1  =  13
8  + 3 + 2  =  13
7  + 5 + 1  =  13
7  + 4 + 2  =  13
7  + 3 + 3  =  13
6  + 6 + 1  =  13
6  + 5 + 2  =  13
6  + 4 + 3  =  13

- this is clearly not enough information
- the she tells us if you mulitply the ages you get a number equal to windows in the building opposite
- so lets multiply the possible ages now

11 x 1 x 1  =  11
10 x 2 x 1  =  20
9  x 3 x 1  =  27
9  x 2 x 2  =  36
8  x 4 x 1  =  32
8  x 3 x 2  =  48
7  x 5 x 1  =  35
7  x 4 x 2  =  56
7  x 3 x 3  =  63
6  x 6 x 1  =  36
6  x 5 x 2  =  60
6  x 4 x 3  =  72

Assuming that the other programmer knows the numers of windows in the opposite building, she should know straight away about the ages
But she is still not sure about the ages
Which means it has to be between these two combinations

9  x 2 x 2  =  36
6  x 6 x 1  =  36

Now at this point the first programmer says that her eldest son has red hair.
And in the above age combinations there is only one with the one eldest

9+2+2 = 13
